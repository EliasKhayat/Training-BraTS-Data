# MRIMath
This repository is the MRIMath team's approach to the BraTS 2018 Challenge using Mask R-CNN. 
### Requirements (it may work with lower versions too, but not guaranteed) 
Keras==2.2.0  
tensorflow-gpu==1.8.0  
CUDA==9.0
### Getting Started
Pull down the repository, and run the 'configure' script to install all python dependencies, download the BraTS 2018 data, and pull in the Mask R-CNN submodule. Once this has finished, you should be able to run 'mrimath.py' through command line or your favorite IDE.
# About MRIMath
Rowan University's Deep Learning research lab, lead by Dr. Nidhal Bouaynaya and Dr. Ghulam Rasool, primarily specializes in applying deep learning to segmentation tasks. While the applications are typically related to brain MRI or potholes, we hope that our work can be used by other researchers and hobbyists.
